Goals:

1. Make the turtlebot respond to basically any kind of input
2. Make it respond to EVERY input
3. average them in some fun way

Right now pyglet.input looks like the best option for control. pyglet is some crazy software library (i thnk the gl stands for gl) but its input support looks good:
- cross-platform
- bluetooth or usb
- easy and abstracted
